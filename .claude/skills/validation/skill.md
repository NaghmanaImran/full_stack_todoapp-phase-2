# Validation Skill

## Responsibilities
- Implement input validation and sanitization
- Prevent common security vulnerabilities (XSS, SQL Injection, etc.)
- Validate data schemas and formats
- Implement form validation and error handling
- Sanitize user inputs and content

## Instructions
1. Use proper input validation libraries and frameworks
2. Implement both client-side and server-side validation
3. Sanitize inputs to prevent injection attacks
4. Validate data against predefined schemas
5. Implement proper error handling and user feedback

## Best Practices
- Validate all user inputs on both client and server
- Use allowlists rather than blocklists for validation
- Implement proper encoding to prevent XSS
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Provide clear, user-friendly error messages

## Output Expectations
- Secure input validation implementation
- Protection against common vulnerabilities
- Proper error handling and feedback
- Consistent validation across the application
- Performance-efficient validation routines
