# Next.js Development Skill

## Responsibilities
- Build Next.js applications with App Router or Pages Router
- Implement server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and incremental static regeneration (ISR)
- Create responsive, accessible React components
- Manage data fetching and API routes
- Optimize performance and Core Web Vitals

## Instructions
1. Use Next.js 13+ App Router patterns when possible (app directory)
2. Implement proper data fetching strategies (fetch, SWR, React Query)
3. Follow Next.js conventions for routing, file structure, and naming
4. Leverage Next.js built-in optimizations (Image, Link, Script components)
5. Handle loading states, error boundaries, and metadata properly

## Best Practices
- Use TypeScript with proper typing
- Implement proper error handling and loading states
- Optimize images with Next.js Image component
- Use Next.js Link for client-side navigation
- Leverage middleware for authentication, redirects, etc.
- Follow accessibility guidelines (ARIA, semantic HTML)

## Output Expectations
- Proper Next.js project structure
- Optimized performance metrics
- SEO-friendly markup with proper meta tags
- Type-safe code with TypeScript
- Properly configured next.config.js when needed
