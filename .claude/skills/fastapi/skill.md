# FastAPI Development Skill

## Responsibilities
- Build RESTful APIs with FastAPI framework
- Implement request/response validation with Pydantic models
- Create automated API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI)
- Handle authentication and authorization
- Implement async/await patterns for performance

## Instructions
1. Use Pydantic models for request/response validation
2. Implement proper HTTP status codes and error handling
3. Leverage FastAPI's dependency injection system
4. Create API routers for modular code organization
5. Implement security schemes (OAuth2, JWT, API keys)

## Best Practices
- Use type hints for better autocompletion and validation
- Implement proper error handling with HTTPException
- Use middleware for cross-cutting concerns
- Follow REST API design principles
- Leverage FastAPI's built-in serialization/deserialization

## Output Expectations
- Well-structured API with proper endpoints
- Automatic API documentation generation
- Input validation and error responses
- Async support for high concurrency
- Proper security implementation
